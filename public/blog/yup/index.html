				<p>ngl this ended up sounding way cheesier than i expected. also i&rsquo;m too lazy to make it anymore cohesive. sorry lmfao</p>
<p>years in the making, so many different websites and many iterations later. i&rsquo;ve done it again. however clumsy and amateurish i may still be, this time i&rsquo;m more confident than ever.</p>
<p>started out in 2019 with a simple &ldquo;carrd&rdquo;, because i saw a friend with one and thought it was a cool idea so i gave it a shot. also i became tired of having to list out multiple social links in my bio every time. it&rsquo;s nice, convenient. then like a year later i found out about neocities and decided to try and take a crack at it myself. still no more functional, and probably worse than the carrd that preceded it, but it was made by my own hand. even later then i took a crack at Hugo. starting with a premade theme then trying to adapt one for my own use. decently functional, but it&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t do everything i want it to for my purposes, and it didn&rsquo;t feel like me.</p>
<p>at that point i went back to having a basic html link list, just a glorified linktree, remade it and updated it a good few times but it was still the bare minimum.</p>
<p>more now than ever, i felt it important to consolidate everything i do to one place, so that no one has to hunt around to find scattered traces of my shit, and so that if one thing goes down, i don&rsquo;t go down with it.</p>
<p>so Literally Yesterday as of writing this, i finally decided i wanted something better. this time i started in figma to sketch out a design to build off of. then scrapped together my rudimentary html/css skills and built it out. i then took what i learned about hugo, and put it into practice. this time not starting with a theme, making it all from scratch.</p>
<p>and here we are now. it&rsquo;s still quite basic, rather amateur, given, i&rsquo;m an artist with basic tech literacy and NOT a dev, but for once i have a website that Feels Like Me, and i&rsquo;m proud of that.</p>
<p>hopefully fun things will go down here. that or i&rsquo;ll forget about it to collect dust like the old blog attempts. /shrug</p>
