				<p>this is adapted from a reply i left on a forum, not everything is verifiably entirely true, it&rsquo;s just a raw dump of my thoughts at the time.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>the funny thing about FL that truly sets it apart from any other DAW is that it&rsquo;s three parts that are only very loosely connected together in sometimes unintuitive ways.</p>
<p>and this is all down to where it came from and how it evolved. while almost every daw on the market started out as either an audio editor or a midi sequencer, FL&rsquo;s beginnings was as a sampler step-sequencer, then it got software instruments that act similarly to those samples, effects channels that you can route those into individually that evolved into a full-blown mixer, basic song arrangement for those sequences that turned into a full-blown audio timeline-ish ordeal, and slowly grew over time to have odd facsimilies of what look like typical DAW features but actually function much differently. really an interesting case.</p>
<p>as for the software itself, though i don&rsquo;t use it much as of late, and i don&rsquo;t find myself recommending it to people anymore because it&rsquo;s foreign to the way pretty much all other audio software works, i do find it quite cozy. especially with the custom colour themes they added in the new updates. the gui runs buttery smooth and the design language is quite nice.</p>
