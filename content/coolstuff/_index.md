#### // about the site

my site is built from the ground using notepad++ (windows), textmate (mac), or kate (linux), depending on what platform i'm on at the time. hosted for free on github pages.

main font is Jura from Google.

background is made myself using Blender (just search like. metalheart blender tutorial or something). since it's monochrome and relatively simple, i reduced it to 16 colours (shades of grey), meaning at 4k as a png it's only a bit over 300kb. ive seen minimal improvement in size from using other image codecs as a result (tried jpeg-xl and lossless webp). i just think that's kinda cool.
