## // site


this site is built wtih the Hugo framework. it is based on no existing template, rather one i built entirely myself. you can view the source [here](https://github.com/pixycc/sitey), though i highly recommend against it. it is an utter fucking mess. eventually i might clean it up and make it a public template tho.

i made and rendered the background myself in Blender, then crunched it down to 16 colours (shades of grey). i considered transcoding to more efficient codecs (lossless webp, jpeg-xl) but the size improvement was so miniscule i dropped them.


### / software

i'd best turn this into its own page tbh. and fuck man i don't wanna make all of these into clickable links (but i really should).

there's probably more i'm forgetting. i'll update this later.

if i list all my music/audio stuff, it'd have to be its own page due to sheer volume. i'll update this page to link to it if i do.

### / hardware

ryzen 3 3100, 1660 super, 32gb ddr4 3600, 1tb nvme (and many random odd sata drives i keep disconnected until i need them). housed in a case i'm missing all the screws and standoffs to, on a partially busted mobo.

constantly bouncing back and forth between windows 10 and 11, and sometimes fedora kde

keychron k4, mx master 2s

random junk 1080p monitor (looking to get a u3011, u3014, or up3017 because because 16:10 is PEAK)

presonus audiobox usb 96 (i HIGHLY recommend **AGAINST** buying presonus)

audio technica ath-m50x - one of the hinges broke so i had to glue it back together. now it works again but it doesn't fold :(

blue snowball ice (i used to have an mxl 991 but i broke it by accident. i'm looking to get an sm57 the next chance i get though)

random $30 32-key midi keyboard (any'll do)

hercules inpulse 300 mk2 (was gifted to me. if i had a choice it would've been a pioneer)

-

MacBook Pro 15" Mid-2015 - i7-4870HQ, R9 M370X 2gb, 16gb ddr3, 512gb ssd

dual booting macos 10.14 Mojave and macos 13 Ventura via OpenCore Legacy Patcher

the battery life is abysmal and i'm not entirely sure why. i think the refurbisher who sold me it might've fucked something up when they swapped the mobo.

samsung galaxy note9, lavendar purple, 512gb. last uncompromised flagship phone, 3.5mm jack, micro sd card reader, fingerprint reader on back. also while i dont mind hole-punches i prefer the large bezel of the note9. every day i contemplate whether i should just move on already. oh and i doodle with it sometimes.
