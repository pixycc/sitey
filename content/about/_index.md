## // site


this site is built wtih the Hugo framework. it is based on no existing template, rather one i built entirely myself. you can view the source [here](https://github.com/pixycc/sitey), though i highly recommend against it. it is an utter fucking mess. eventually i might clean it up and make it a public template tho.

i made and rendered the background myself in Blender, then crunched it down to 16 colours (shades of grey). i considered transcoding to more efficient codecs (lossless webp, jpeg-xl) but the size improvement was so miniscule i dropped them.


### / software

i'd best turn this into its own page tbh. and fuck man i don't wanna make all of these into clickable links (but i really should).

there's probably more i'm forgetting. i'll update this later.

if i list all my music/audio stuff, it'd have to be its own page due to sheer volume. i'll update this page to link to it if i do.

### / hardware

ryzen 3 3100, 1660 super, 32gb ddr4 3600, 1tb nvme (and many random odd sata drives i keep disconnected until i need them). housed in a case i'm missing all the screws and standoffs to, on a partially busted mobo.

constantly bouncing back and forth between windows 10 and 11, and sometimes fedora kde

keychron k4, mx master 2s

random junk 1080p monitor (looking to get a u3011, u3014, or up3017 because because 16:10 is PEAK)

presonus audiobox usb 96 (i HIGHLY recommend **AGAINST** buying presonus)

audio technica ath-m50x - one of the hinges broke so i had to glue it back together. now it works again but it doesn't fold :(

blue snowball ice (i used to have an mxl 991 but i broke it by accident. i'm looking to get an sm57 the next chance i get though)

random $30 32-key midi keyboard (any'll do)

hercules inpulse 300 mk2 (was gifted to me. if i had a choice it would've been a pioneer)

-

MacBook Pro 15" Mid-2015 - i7-4870HQ, R9 M370X 2gb, 16gb ddr3, 512gb ssd

dual booting macos 10.14 Mojave and macos 13 Ventura via OpenCore Legacy Patcher

the battery life is abysmal and i'm not entirely sure why. i think the refurbisher who sold me it might've fucked something up when they swapped the mobo.

-

samsung galaxy note9, lavendar purple, 512gb. last uncompromised flagship phone, 3.5mm jack, micro sd card reader, fingerprint reader on back. also while i dont mind hole-punches i prefer the large bezel of the note9. every day i contemplate whether i should just move on already. oh and i doodle with it sometimes.
