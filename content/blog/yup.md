ngl this ended up sounding way cheesier than i expected. also i'm too lazy to make it anymore cohesive. sorry lmfao

years in the making, so many different websites and many iterations later. i've done it again. however clumsy and amateurish i may still be, this time i'm more confident than ever.

<!--more-->

started out in 2019 with a simple "carrd", because i saw a friend with one and thought it was a cool idea so i gave it a shot. also i became tired of having to list out multiple social links in my bio every time. it's nice, convenient. then like a year later i found out about neocities and decided to try and take a crack at it myself. still no more functional, and probably worse than the carrd that preceded it, but it was made by my own hand. even later then i took a crack at Hugo. starting with a premade theme then trying to adapt one for my own use. decently functional, but it's doesn't do everything i want it to for my purposes, and it didn't feel like me.

at that point i went back to having a basic html link list, just a glorified linktree, remade it and updated it a good few times but it was still the bare minimum.

more now than ever, i felt it important to consolidate everything i do to one place, so that no one has to hunt around to find scattered traces of my shit, and so that if one thing goes down, i don't go down with it.

so Literally Yesterday as of writing this, i finally decided i wanted something better. this time i started in figma to sketch out a design to build off of. then scrapped together my rudimentary html/css skills and built it out. i then took what i learned about hugo, and put it into practice. this time not starting with a theme, making it all from scratch.

and here we are now. it's still quite basic, rather amateur, given, i'm an artist with basic tech literacy and NOT a dev, but for once i have a website that Feels Like Me, and i'm proud of that.

hopefully fun things will go down here. that or i'll forget about it to collect dust like the old blog attempts. /shrug
