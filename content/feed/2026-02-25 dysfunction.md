it's about that time of year again, the point where i say im going to do a whole lot on my website just to inevitably forget about it. happens with so many projects and things i think about doing just not to. i *am* getting a little better about it though. i've been making heavy use of Notion so i write things down instead of letting them be forgotten. i have many draft posts and ideas stacked up here and there that i'm slowly chipping away at.
